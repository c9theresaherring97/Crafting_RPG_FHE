# Crafting RPG: The Encrypted Artisan Adventure 🎮🔒

Crafting RPG is an innovative role-playing game (RPG) powered by **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology**. In this immersive world, players embark on a thrilling journey where crafting legendary gear requires rare and encrypted components. As players explore, they experiment with enigmatic FHE-encrypted "catalysts" that hold mysterious properties, encouraging them to discover their true potential through trial and error.

## The Problem Statement 🛠️

In many crafting games, players often find themselves limited by predictable outcomes when attempting to create unique items. The crafting process can become monotonous, leading to a lack of engagement and excitement. Furthermore, the transparency of material values makes the game predictable, reducing the thrill of exploration and experimentation that players crave. 

## Unleashing the FHE Solution 🔑

Crafting RPG transforms the conventional crafting experience by implementing **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)**, developed using Zama's powerful open-source libraries. By encrypting key synthesis materials, we create a gameplay mechanic where players must rely on ingenuity and experimentation to discover the effects of each component. Zama's technology ensures that even though players do not understand the exact attributes of their materials, they can still use them to craft stunning and powerful gear—all while maintaining the privacy of sensitive data.

The integration of Zama's **Concrete** and **TFHE-rs** libraries allows us to perform homomorphic computations directly on encrypted data. This means that players can engage in authentic experimentation while the game maintains the confidentiality of in-game resources.

## Key Features ✨

- **Encrypted Crafting Materials:** Crafting components are FHE encrypted, introducing an element of mystery and requiring players to experiment with combinations to discover their effects.
  
- **Homomorphic Calculation of Synthesis Results:** Players benefit from a seamless synthesis process where encrypted inputs yield encrypted outputs, allowing for unique item creations without revealing underlying data.

- **Dynamic Experimentation:** The crafting interface turns from a mechanistic process into an exploratory journey, enhancing the overall enjoyment and depth of manufacturing items.

- **Robust Material Database:** The game includes a comprehensive library of materials, each with unique properties that players can uncover through gameplay.

- **Sandbox Style Gameplay:** Players are encouraged to freely explore and experiment within a vast world, making every crafting session a unique adventure.

## Technology Stack 🧰

## Installation Guide 📦

To set up the Crafting RPG project on your machine, follow these steps:

1. **Download the project** to your local system (do not use `git clone`).
2. Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed (version 14 or above).
3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
4. Install the required dependencies by running:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   This command will fetch the necessary libraries, including Zama's FHE SDK, for confidential computing.

## Build & Run Guide 🚀

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can build and run the project using the following commands:

1. **To compile the smart contracts:**

   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

2. **To run the test suite:**

   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```

3. **To start the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

Now you're ready to explore the enchanting world of crafting, filled with surprises and challenges!

## Code Example 💡

Here’s a brief example of how to use our crafting function, demonstrating the encrypted synthesis of materials:

```solidity
// Solidity function to synthesize materials
function synthesizeMaterials(bytes encryptedMaterialA, bytes encryptedMaterialB) public returns (bytes memory) {
    // Perform homomorphic computation on encrypted materials
    bytes memory result = homomorphicAdd(encryptedMaterialA, encryptedMaterialB);
    return result; // This returns the encrypted synthesis result
}
```

In this example, `homomorphicAdd` is a function that computes the synthesis of two encrypted materials, ensuring that the underlying data remains confidential.
